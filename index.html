        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Pay attention to what you are typing, a single character out of place can cause the code not to work.</li>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), to give the content structure.</li> 
          <li>HTML is made up of elements which work to provide content as well as a basic frame work. </li> 
          <li>elements are a type of content, including text, images, headers and lists. Other elements can be used to divide content and even describe what is seen on the brower, such as meta-related, content divison and semantic elements. </li>
          <li>In HTML, nearly all codes are case sensitive, but doctype is not.</li>
          <li>HTML attribute defiens additional information about an element and are always found in the beginning and not the closing element</li>
          <li>Metadata is about the webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve the webpage to users. However, it is not typical seen by users. Rather it contains important information about accessibilty, search engines and performance.</li>
          <li> The roles of the head and meta elements: The head element is a container for metadata. meta elements contain information about the page that is used by the browser. The user won’t see information in the head or meta elements.</li>
          <li>The style element defines CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage</li>
          <li>The link element connects an extgeral resource to the HTML doc.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author and viewport.</li>
          <li>The roles of the head element is a container for the metadata. The meta elements contain information about the page that is used by the proswer. Users won't see information on either.</li>
          <li>charset elements sets our character encoding.</li>
          <li>http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content</li>
          <li>vieweport element sets the default view for our webpage</li>
          <li>An HTML developer is responsible for not only providing the structure for the webpage but also making sure that it provides a positive user experience.</li>
          <li>pulled nerd note from module 3.1.4: Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. If there are three elements nested inside of a body element, those three nested elements are known as child elements. The element that holds all the children—in this case, the body element—is known as the parent element. This “parent/child” language is often used by developers to explain the relationship among elements in HTML.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML (pulled from 3.1.4): In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. When possible, it is important to use semantic HTML elements, because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser. Semantic HTML also plays an important role in making sure your webpage is accessible to the widest variety of users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers. BUT NOT ALL ELEMENTS ARE SEMEANTIC: div and psan.</li>
          <lI>p = PARAGRAPH // h1-6 are headings, ul is unlisted, li is listed, img is for image and is used with scr. br creates a line of empty space between two blocks of content. a is for anchor, href points to an URL.</lI>
          <li>* The `src` attribute defines the location, or source, of the image file.

            * The `alt` attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
          <li>HIGH IMPORTANT: ORDER MATTERS!</li>
          <li> pulled from 3.1.5: Developers test code early and often to catch bugs. Sometimes testing can be as simple as looking for changes in the browser, like we are doing here, to see if the webpage is rendering as expected.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>pulled from 3.2.1: ascading Style Sheets (CSS), which is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users. Whereas HTML strictly handles the structure and content of a webpage, CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization. We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. They’re useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
          <li>pulled from nerd note 3.2.3: Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use. It is one of the key design principles that we practice in the boot camp. Separation of concerns is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility. </li>
          <li> there will be a selector color and then value</li>
          <li>Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY): a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained</li>
          <li>DEBUGGING IS HIGHLY IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL! pulled from Nerd Note 3.2.4: Debugging is one of the most important parts of the development process. Every day, developers notice errors and review code that isn’t working. It’s important to get into the mindset that errors and mistakes are gifts. They tell us when something is wrong, and if we can stay curious, we can figure out what is happening and learn something new.</li>\

          <li>Enter your JavaScript notes here</li>
          <li>Javascript has a few different data types: dynamic and weak typing, primitive values, objects, type coercion and all of their subsections which can be referred to in the link in the prework module.</li>
          <li> .js refers to a javascrip file, while .html refers to HTML and .css refers to CCS.</li>
          <li>A variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>pulled from deep dive in 3.3.3: The word console refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code. The second part, .log(), is a method, which means a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer. The .log() method will output whatever we add inside the parentheses to the console.</li>
          <li>Connecting .css to .html through adding a -link- element inside the head. Head elements contain meta information for the brower. Adding links to related files there in order to tell the brower what's included in the website and how the files should interacti.</li>
          <li>Use google chrome for google dev tools.</li>
          <li>pulled from 3.3.3 on the job: The console.log method was created to make it easier for developers to test their code. Developers use it daily to debug and test the code that they write. Soon, using it will become second nature for you too!</li>
          <li>3.3.4: Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
          <li>THE ORDER OF THE CODE AFFECTS THE OUTCOME</li>
          <li>Control flows can be interrupted by conditional statements and loops in order to decide which code is excuted or if it is at all.</li>
          <li>IF statements: code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true. -plate shelf sorting example</li>
          <li>Pulled from 3.3.4 Deep Dive: What exactly do we mean by “truthy” and “falsy” in Javascript? A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false. All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy.</li>
          <li>Javascript can have more than one condidtion 'else if'</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types.</li>
          <li>To work with individual data items inside an array, we need to have one more piece of information: the location of the data item in the array. This location is identified with a unique number called an index. Using each piece of data's index, or location number, we can access individual data inside the array.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional if statement that we just learned, to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times. he array length is important because the for loop needs to know how many times the code will run until there are no items left in the array. We can find the length of an array by using a built-in property of an array, appropriately named length. efore we break down a for loop, let's revisit the topic of variables from earlier in the lesson. Remember that up until now, we've declared variables using the const keyword, which "locks down" the value of the variable so that it can't be reassigned. This is where we would use the let keyword. Just like with const, we use let, followed by a unique variable name and the assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable. However, unlike with const, let allows us to reassign the value of the variable over time. This is especially important in cases where we need to use the variable to store changing values, like when iterating over an array using a for loop.</li>
          <li>A for loop contains the following three important statements:

            The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable x and give it a value of 0 (because the first index of an array is always 0).
            The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running. This will allow the loop to execute one time for each item in the array. We use the length built-in array property on our shapes array to express that condition.
            The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops, x will increase by 1.
